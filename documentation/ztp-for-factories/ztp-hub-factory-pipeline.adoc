The hub configuration pipeline stage prepares the hub cluster to deploy multiple edge clusters for the end customer.

The flow associated with deploying the hub cluster is:

Check hub::

The initial stages in the hub pipeline downloads the various tools needed. It downloads `jq`, `oc`, `opm` and `kubectl`. It also proceeds to verify that various hub install prerequisites exist before proceeding, for example it checks the:

* {product-title} version.
* Nodes are ready.
* Cluster Operators are ready.
* Metal3 pods are ready.
* Persistent volumes are created.
* DNS requirements are satisfied.

Deploy HTTPD::

This step deploys and configures an HTTP server on the hub cluster. It obtains the Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS) ISO and RootFS images from link:https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/pre-release/[mirror.openshift.com] and ensures these are hosted on the deployed HTTPD server. These are then available to install on the edge cluster.

Deploy registry::

This step deploys a registry on the hub cluster. The substeps involved in this process are as follows:

   * Deploy the registry on the hub.
   * Sync the {product-title} and Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) images from Quay and Red Hat registries to the internal registry.
   * Update the pull secret globally.

In case you have your own registry already deployed, you should add the next info to the config yaml file:
`REGISTRY: <url-registry:port>`
and update the pull secret with the registry entry (url, username and password ) in order to make easy the authentication in your own registry without credentials.
In this scenario, your own registry will be used as the hub registry in the pipeline.

Deploy RHACM::

This step installs the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Manager and Assisted Installer on the {product-title} hub cluster. Red Hat Advanced Cluster Manager manages the deployment on many managed edge clusters.

Transition to disconnected::

This step deploys the ImageContentSourcePolicy (ISCP) and the Catalog sources for the hub to point to itself as a source of the images and operator. From this step forward, the hub cluster is no longer connected to the Internet.

Deploy Assisted Installer::

This step ensures the Assisted Installer service supports installing the edge clusters. This step configures the way the edge cluster is deployed, the certificates, the image sources, the cluster details, and so on.

At this stage, the hub cluster is ready to install the edge cluster.
