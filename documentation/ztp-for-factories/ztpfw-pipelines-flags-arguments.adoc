The pipeline arguments and flags are described in the following tables.

.Pipeline flags
[cols="30%,70%",options="header"]
|===
| Flag | Description

| `-n`
|{product-title} namespace where the resources are located.

| `-p`
| Pipeline parameter.

| `--timeout`
|Pipeline general timeout.

| `--use-param-defaults`
| Specifies that apart from the parameters provided, the remainder use the default options.

| `-w`
|The workspace parameter sets where {product-title} pipelines hold the files during every step. Do not use EmptyDir. The best choice is `name=ztp,claimName=ztp-pvc`. The persistent volume claim  is created during the `bootstrap.sh` execution. It does not need more than 5Gb.

.Pipeline arguments
[cols="30%,50%,20",options="header"]
|===
| Flag | Description | Required

| `Namespace`
|This is a namespace where all the Tasks and Pipelines will be deployed.
|Yes

| `edgeclusters-config`
|This `edgeclusters.yaml` file has the configuration for all the clusters you want to deploy at the same time. Run it with the `cat` command.
|Yes

| `kubeconfig`
| This is the hub `kubeconfig` that is used during the pipeline execution. You can point to the file or just use the `KUBECONFIG` variable.
| Yes

| `-w name=ztp,claimName=ztp-pvc`
|It is mandatory to use this argument exactly as itâ€™s shown here to have a successfull run. This declaration instructs Tekton to use the workspace `ztp` and that the content should be placed in the `ztp-pvc` persistent volume.
|Yes

| `Pipeline Name`
|In the command examples, this is the last argument. This flag instructs Tekton to run the pipeline with the particular name. You can examine the executed pipelines and tasks with `tkn pr ls` and `tkn task ls` respectively.
|Yes
