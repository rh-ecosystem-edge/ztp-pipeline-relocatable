Zero touch provisioning for factory workflows (ZTPFW) accelerates the deployment of {product-title} with pre-certified hardware and software for rapid edge deployments.

ZTP for factory workflows enables original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners to pre-install {product-title} at their factory and build turnkey solutions on their hardware. This approach is well suited to a range of different industries including:

* healthcare
* manufacturing
* aerospace
* media
* entertainment
* retail
* telecommunications

ZTP for factory workflows installs the components that enable you to use {product-title} as a disconnected hub cluster. This hub cluster is then able to deploy edge clusters that can be shipped off site for final configuration.

At the factory, the OEM partner first deploys a hub {product-title} cluster and then uses the hub cluster to deploy one or more edge clusters at scale.

The hub cluster can be a single-node OpenShift (aka SNO) cluster or a compact cluster and it can deploy multiple SNO and/or 3 control plane + 1 worker node edge clusters at scale.

[NOTE]
====
The hub cluster is also known as the factory cluster.
====

The following are the possible combinations of hub and edgecluster cluster topologies:

.Cluster topologies
[options="header"]
|====
|Hub|Edge
|Compact (3 control plane nodes also able to act as worker nodes)
a|3 + 1 (Compact and 1 worker node)

Compact

SNO
| SNO (Control plane and worker node on a single node)
a|3 + 1

Compact

Single-node OpenShift
|====

Whatever the topology, the hub cluster uses {rh-mce-first} and the Assisted Installer (AI) to install edge clusters at scale by using zero touch provisioning (ZTP).

When the edge cluster is installed, it can be shipped to the customer onsite locations and there the end customer unboxes it, and configures the edge cluster making it fully operational.

The actual workflow and its details can be checked at the files inside the `pipelines` folder.
