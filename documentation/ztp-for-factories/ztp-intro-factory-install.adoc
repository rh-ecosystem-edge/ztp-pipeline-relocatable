= About the factory install pipeline

The factory install pipeline builds out your factory environment (hub and edge clusters) in readiness for the edge cluster to be shipped off site. Red Hat has created a set of community scripts to help you get started with this task.

A GitHub repository contains all the relevant scripts and YAML files you need to provision the hub cluster and edge clusters.

The edge cluster installation uses a zero touch provisioning (ZTP) approach facilitated by {rh-mce-first} using the Assisted Installer (AI) installed as part of running the factory install pipeline.

With ZTP and AI, you can provision many {product-title} edge clusters in a factory-type setting. MCE manages clusters in a hub and edge architecture, where a single hub cluster manages many edge clusters. A hub cluster running MCE provisions and deploys the edge clusters using ZTP and AI. AI provisions {product-title} on the bare-metal edge clusters.
