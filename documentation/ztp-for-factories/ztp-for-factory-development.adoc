== Deploying the environment in Virtual

This is a very expensive option to work with all nodes in virtual, which means, you will need a big server to make this work:

=== Hardware requirements
Hardware Reqs for the Hub (3 Nodes):

- CPUs: 48 (16 each)
- RAM: 54 Gbs (18 each)
- Storage: 300 Gbs (each)

Hardware Reqs for the Edge Cluster (3 Master + 1 Worker Nodes):

Master Nodes:

- CPUs: 72 (24 each)
- RAM: 192 (64 each)
- Storage: 4 extra disks with 200Gb each one

Worker Node:
- CPUs: 12
- RAM: 16
- Storage: 4 extra disks with 200Gb each one

=== Software requirements

- Libvirtd/Qemu/KVM
- Kcli (https://github.com/karmab/kcli) for the scripts.
- Some binaries oc, kubectl, tkn, yq, jq and ketall (for debugging)

=== Deploying the Base Hub

Deploys the Hub cluster with an NFS as a Base Storage for the requirements

```console
git clone git@github.com:rh-ecosystem-edge/ztp-pipeline-relocatable.git
cd ztp-pipeline-relocatable/hack/deploy-hub-local
./build-hub.sh ${HOME}/openshift_pull.json ${OCP_VERSION} ${ACM_VERSION} ${ODF_VERSION} compact
```

=== Bootstraping OpenShift Pipelines

Installs the necessary things to start executing the Pipelines

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=/root/.kcli/clusters/test-ci/auth/kubeconfig
curl -sLk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-ecosystem-edge/ztp-pipeline-relocatable/main/pipelines/bootstrap.sh | bash -s
```

=== Executing the Hub Pipeline

You can customize the parameter `git-revision=<BRANCH>` to point to your own branch

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=/root/.kcli/clusters/test-ci/auth/kubeconfig
tkn pipeline start -n edgecluster-deployer -p ztp-container-image="quay.io/ztpfw/pipeline:main" -p edgeclusters-config="$(cat /root/amorgant/ztp-pipeline-relocatable/hack/deploy-hub-local/edgeclusters.yaml)" -p kubeconfig=${KUBECONFIG} -w name=ztp,claimName=ztp-pvc --timeout 5h --use-param-defaults deploy-ztp-hub
```

=== Creating the Edge Cluster VMs

Creates 4 VMs and the proper DNS entries for the involved network

```sh
./build-edgecluster.sh ${HOME}/openshift_pull.json ${OCP_VERSION} ${ACM_VERSION} ${ODF_VERSION} compact
```

=== Executing the Edge Cluster Pipeline

You can customize the parameter `git-revision=<BRANCH>` to point to your own branch

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=/root/.kcli/clusters/test-ci/auth/kubeconfig
tkn pipeline start -n edgecluster-deployer \
            -p ztp-container-image="$(PIPE_IMAGE):$(BRANCH)" \
            -p edgeclusters-config="$$(cat $(EDGECLUSTERS_FILE))" \
            -p kubeconfig=${KUBECONFIG} \
            -w name=ztp,claimName=ztp-pvc \
            --timeout 5h \
            --pod-template ./pipelines/resources/common/pod-template.yaml \
            --use-param-defaults deploy-ztp-edgeclusters
```

== Build Images

You will need first access to the Quay Organization called **ZTPFW**, just ask whoever people involved in the project.

You have some targets already in the Makefile, and today you just need to execute:

```sh
make
```

this will change in the future to add functionality to the Image building

== Executing a Pipeline Step

Imagine you have an environment already deployed and you need to test the step you are working on, think on for example the UI. For that you just need to:

- First step you updates the code in the PVC (This can change in the futurte when we embed the code in the Container Image)

```sh
tkn task start -n edgecluster-deployer -p git-revision=<YOUR BRANCH> -p edgeclusters-config="$(cat /root/jparrill/ztp-pipeline-relocatable/hack/deploy-hub-local/edgeclusters.yaml)" -p kubeconfig=${KUBECONFIG} -w name=ztp,claimName=ztp-pvc --timeout 5h --use-param-defaults fetch-from-git
```

- This second one executes the Pipeline Step
```sh
tkn task start -n edgecluster-deployer -p git-revision=<YOUR BRANCH> -p edgeclusters-config="$(cat /root/jparrill/ztp-pipeline-relocatable/hack/deploy-hub-local/edgeclusters.yaml)" -p kubeconfig=${KUBECONFIG} -w name=ztp,claimName=ztp-pvc --timeout 5h --use-param-defaults edgecluster-deploy-ui
```
