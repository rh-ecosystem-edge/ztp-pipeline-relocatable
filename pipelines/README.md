# ZTP Using Openshift Pipelines

## Prereqs

- You need at least a hub cluster deployed and functional and an accesible Kubeconfig file
- The clsuter should be IPv4/Connected
- An Spokes file (you can create one using [this](https://github.com/rh-ecosystem-edge/ztp-pipeline-relocatable/blob/tekton-pipeline/examples/config.yaml) as a sample.

## Quickstart

- First you need to execute the script using curl command

## Clarifications

- This is to achieve the final end of ZTP at the factory project.
- It's not compatible with typical ZTP workflow

## Workflow

### Bootstrap

- Execute the bootstrap script file `pipelines/bootstrap.sh ${KUBECONFIG}` you can do that using this command:

```
export KUBECONFIG=/root/.kcli/clusters/test-ci/auth/kubeconfig
curl -sLk https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rh-ecosystem-edge/ztp-pipeline-relocatable/tekton-pipeline/pipelines/bootstrap.sh | bash -s -- ${KUBECONFIG}
```

- This is the output:

```

This script will deploy Openshift-Pipelines and enable the Tasks and Pipelines into your Hub cluster.
Then you can continue the flow using the Command Line or the UI.

### Hub Pipeline

You will pass some arguments to the Task or Pipeline in order to execute them, for that you need to use the Tekton CLI `tkn` using this [link](https://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/x86_64/clients/pipeline/latest/tkn-linux-amd64-0.21.0.tar.gz)

Now you need to have in mind the arguments for the Pipeline:

- KUBECONFIG=
- SPOKES_FILE=
- SYNC='yes|no'

### Spoke Pipeline
